## 3.0.1

- docs: Update README.md.
- chore: Update Package to support latest dependencies

## 3.0.0

- feat: Added detection for slow internet connections. For detailed usage, refer to the example folder. ([#32](https://github.com/RounakTadvi/internet_connection_checker/issues/32))
- feat: Introduced the `requireAllAddressesToRespond` configuration to control the connectivity status determination. When enabled, InternetConnectionStatus.connected is emitted only if all specified addresses are reachable. If disabled, the status is emitted if any of the addresses is reachable.
- chore: Added an example demonstrating automatic page refresh when the internet connection becomes available.
- chore: Implemented a `dispose` method to prevent memory leaks.
- test: Achieved 100% code coverage, thereby improving the overall code quality.
- chore: Enhanced exception handling in the isHostReachable method for more robust error management.
- chore: Updated the validation criteria for internet availability to use HTTP status code range 100â€“599, ensuring server responses are properly handled.
- docs: Updated README snippets for better clarity and usage examples.
- fix: Ensured connectivity updates are emitted correctly when hasConnection is invoked. ([#43](https://github.com/RounakTadvi/internet_connection_checker/issues/43))
- fix: emit connection status only once in a scenario where the newly detected status is the same as the previous one. ([#35](https://github.com/RounakTadvi/internet_connection_checker/issues/35))
